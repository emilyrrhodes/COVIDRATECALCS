1. Download all the files I need from rscb.org.  
7BWJ - RBD with antibody aligned. 
6VXX or 6XM5 - 0 RBD in up conformation. 
6VYB - 1 RBD in up conformation. 
6X2B - 2 RBD in up conformation. 
7CAK - 3 RBD in up conformation. 

2. Open files in VMD.
Command: 

3. Change the RBD molecules to be named the same thing. 
Command: %s/ E / A / 
Note: Include spaces to ensure that not all of the Es are replaced with As. Change the chain name in only the one you are trying to move.  

4. Open Extension - Analysis - RMSD Trajectory Tool

5. Look at the residue number for which the two molecules you want to align start at. 
Command: vi (pdb file name) 

6. Type in the text box what you want to align. 
Note: Sometimes the structures are missing atoms. You can first start by trying to allign all the "protein" molecules. Then get smaller and smaller until it works and build up from there. 
Command: protein
Command: chain A 
Command: chain A and name CA and resid ### to ### (the first number is the residue number for which molecule starts and the second number is changed to figure out how they are aligned)
Command: chain A and name CA and resid ### to ### ### to ###

7. Save aligned molecule.
